Keep provider-neutral prompts and deterministic fragment compilation in
`packages/genui/lynx-xml`; keep model providers, Agent wiring, streaming, and
request options in GenUI Server.

`enableHtmlFragment` defaults to false and selects both the prompt and Agent
cache variant. Off generates a complete Element PAPI document directly. On
produces one intermediate document containing one `<template>` directly inside
`<lynx>`, alongside CSS and main/background scripts. Accept source blocks in
any order and skip raw scripts, styles, and comments when locating the template.
Require ids only on nodes referenced by handlers, updates, or cleanup; static
nodes do not need ids. After model generation,
compile the fragment, remove the template, and inject `createFragment(page,
pageId)`. This helper appends the initial tree and returns an XML-id-to-node map;
reuse one temporary element reference and a parent stack while building the
tree, and retain only explicitly identified nodes in the returned node map.
The model stores that map at main-thread script scope for later handlers. Do
not generate a separate nodeN variable for each element. Do not register a conversion
tool, retain a placeholder registry, or request another model round on success.
Keep failures explicit; Bench owns configured repairs.

Preserve the exact intermediate model response in `metadata.modelOutput` and
the successful original fragment in `metadata.xmlFragment`. Off omits the
fragment metadata. Stream model text as source evidence, but preview and Judge
only the compiled final document. Preserve usage and finish reason when
postprocessing fails. Test real single-step Mastra generation and streaming,
cache separation, and fragment handlers through render, tap, update, and cleanup.

Use the pinned `@lynx-js/skill-vanilla-lynx` dependency for shared document,
Element PAPI, lifecycle, event, background, and style guidance. Select and
sanitize Markdown in `src/vanilla-lynx-skill.ts`, import with `?raw`, and inline
it through Rslib and Rstest. Do not duplicate shared guidance or add runtime
filesystem reads, Rspeedy, external bundles, or a required `globalThis.processData`
contract. Keep local prompt overrides deterministic and tested.

Keep fragment parsing bounded by length and nesting depth. Preserve source
order, XML entities and nonempty text whitespace, reject duplicate ids and
unsupported source elements, and never execute model JavaScript on the server.
Compile explicit `raw-text` leaves with `__CreateRawText`, preserving XML entities
and deliberate whitespace; accept text content or the `text` attribute, and
reject nested elements or ambiguous simultaneous text sources.
Keep `eslint-scope` external in the intermediate library build; bundle it once
in the consuming server to avoid duplicated CommonJS module tables.

Keep shared product and mobile design intent in `packages/genui/server/design/design-guidance.ts`
and concrete Lynx APIs in `src/prompt.ts`. Require applied classes with explicit `display: flex` and
`flex-direction` on layout containers. Both `__AppendElement` arguments must
be nodes; reserve `pageId` for page-owned creation APIs. For long content, append
one definite-height vertical scroll view directly to Page, without a business
view wrapper. Keep Page visually unstyled, consume host-provided safe-area
insets once, reserve fixed-bar space, specify image dimensions, and provide
legible text and 44px touch targets. Use supported literal CSS values and Lynx
accessibility attributes; do not import Web-only layout, ARIA, CSS variables,
or `env(safe-area-inset-*)`. User design systems may override visual defaults,
not runtime contracts.
