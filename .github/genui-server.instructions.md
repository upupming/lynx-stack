Apply the selected model's `reasoningEffort` through the shared run options for all generation agents, including streaming, tool continuations, and Bench repair attempts. Leave it omitted when unconfigured; never force a global effort default or inherit server model settings into a complete custom provider. For compatible providers with configured effort, enable the SDK's reasoning-model override so opaque upstream model aliases retain the parameter, preserve the system-message role, and do not implicitly request reasoning summaries. Log the resolved effort with the shared agent diagnostics, and verify serialized Chat Completions and Responses requests with deterministic provider mocks.

# GenUI Server Architecture

UI Judge must work with configured models that reject native json_schema response formats. Set Mastra structuredOutput.jsonPromptInjection to true, keep the Zod score schema and strict local validation, and omit native response_format/text.format on the wire. Do not switch models or add another structuring-agent pass. Verify both Chat Completions and Responses requests against deterministic endpoints that only return JSON text, including invalid score output.

Pace UI Judge model calls through a process-wide queue keyed by the resolved upstream base URL and model, so public aliases and separate Bench jobs share admission. Keep two calls active at most and space starts by at least one second. Retain five independent scoring dimensions and their weights. Disable SDK retries and retry only a failed dimension, at most three attempts, retaining completed dimensions. Reuse the shared transient-error classifier and Retry-After parser; without a provider hint, wait 60 seconds for HTTP 429 and use exponential backoff for other transient failures. Publish cooldowns to the shared queue before releasing request slots, keep waits abortable within the Judge deadline, and drain active calls on failure. Read Mastra result errors before validating scores. After scoring starts, never retry the whole capture/evaluation pipeline; preserve bounded capture retries for capture failures. Verify wire-level retry counts with real Mastra and deterministic Chat/Responses mocks.

Organize both `agent` and `service` into `common`, `a2ui`, `openui`, `html`, `lynx-xml`, and `mcp-apps`. Keep protocol factories, prompts, catalogs, parsing, validation, and custom tools in `agent/<protocol>`, and generation services and protocol-specific Bench adapters in `service/<protocol>`. Shared provider helpers, Mastra storage, search/image tools, and screenshot evaluation belong in `agent/common`. Cross-protocol Bench scheduling, request normalization, report storage/types, redaction, screenshot conversion, and Judge orchestration belong in `service/common/bench`; this orchestration may wire protocol implementations, while ordinary common helpers remain independent of protocol services. Move files without changing runtime behavior or leaving old-path forwarding modules. Update consumers, mocks, documentation scopes, and the A2UI prompt package's exports, TypeScript includes, and Turbo inputs together.

Keep shared design guidance in `design/design-guidance.ts` as one `GENUI_DESIGN_GUIDANCE` constant, with separate product and mobile sections inside the prompt. Inject it once for every output agent through the shared `enableDesignGuidance` option; keep the sections together unless an independent use case requires separate configuration. Do not place framework, catalog, or runtime API details in the shared design contract.

Treat design guidance as a shared generation capability. It is enabled by default, can be disabled with `enableDesignGuidance: false` for Create requests or individual Bench groups, and must be included in provider-agent cache keys so enabled and disabled agents are never reused interchangeably.

Keep protocol-neutral request infrastructure in `app/common`. Request-size enforcement, JSON parsing, chat and conversation validation, provider override selection, error and usage extraction, CORS, rate limiting, SSE encoding and headers, and stream logging must not live under a protocol route such as `app/a2ui`.

Keep shared agent-service contracts and helpers in `service/common`. `ChatMessage`, `ConversationContext`, generic provider options, provider agent caching, conversation assembly, model-message conversion, Mastra result extraction, and stream adaptation must not be imported from `service/a2ui/a2ui-agent` by OpenUI or MCP Apps. Extend the generic options inside `service/a2ui/a2ui-agent` only for A2UI-specific catalog and repair settings.

Use `service/common/generation-repair.ts` in artifact-validation repair loops
across protocols. Validate first: `finishReason: length` alone does not invalidate
a complete artifact. If validation fails with `length`, use the remaining repair
budget to request a shorter complete artifact from the original messages, keeping
prior conversation history and data-model context but discarding this run's failed
outputs and repair prompts. Preserve required content/actions, protocol options,
model settings, cancellation, shared tool scopes, and Bench attempt/usage records.
Ordinary validation errors retain their targeted repair feedback. Do not append
closing tags to truncated code or add hidden retries to raw generators.

Keep bounded text-stream recovery in `service/common/text-generation-recovery.ts`.
The Lynx XML streaming service opts in to at most three generation attempts when
an invalid artifact ends with `length`. Try one continuation of a bounded prefix
only when the model echoes its exact trailing source characters, preserving
whitespace. Fall back to compact regeneration on empty output, mismatched
boundaries, or invalid continued output. Validate and compile the assembled
artifact before success. Buffer recovery attempts and publish their final text
through `done`, because a replacement cannot be appended to the initial deltas.
Reuse model options, cancellation, and capability scopes; aggregate every
attempt's usage and expose recovery modes in `metadata.generationAttempts`.
Upstream errors normally stop artifact recovery. Keep raw generation single-call
so Bench continues to own its configured repair budget.

Resolve per-call output limits in `service/common/provider.ts` through
`buildOpenAIRunOptions`. All five generation agents use its shared 16384-token
target for raw generation, streaming, tool resumption, and repairs; never add
protocol-specific budget wrappers or overwrite `modelSettings` after resolving
it. Specialized calls such as Judge may request a smaller target through the
same function, and recovery may request a larger one. Always clamp to the
effective selected model's configured ceiling, including default-model fallback
for unknown names. Complete custom-provider connections do not inherit a
server-model ceiling. Keep maxRetries, reasoning settings, cancellation, and
budget overrides scoped to the invocation. Verify Chat and Responses token
parameters with real SDK mocks across all generation services.

Handle reasoning-only exhaustion separately from artifact continuation. An opted-in
stream may regenerate once when it has no text or non-text output, known positive
input usage, and output usage equal to both the request budget and reasoning usage.
Require either `length` or the observed HTTP 400 `input` / `<nil>` failure; do not
retry generic parameter, authentication, or transport errors. Preserve the original
error and finish reason instead of relabeling them as truncation. Use the original
messages plus a compact-output request, never an empty assistant message or hidden
reasoning. Keep the same model; lower medium/high/unset effort to low without
raising none/minimal/low, and grow the budget by at most 2x only within the selected
model's configured ceiling. Skip unchanged settings and controlled runs with
`inheritReasoningEffort: false`. Count this restart within the three-attempt limit,
reuse cancellation and capability budgets, and retain all usage and request IDs.
Do not persist the override in cached agents. Test both Chat and Responses wire
parameters through the real SDK with deterministic upstream mocks.

Keep public provider integrations vendor-neutral. Do not commit deployment-only gateway rewrites, private hostnames, environment-specific authentication conventions, or credentials; inject those only through the deployment environment.

Normalize missing `output[].content[].annotations` to an empty array only on `output_text` parts of message items in successful JSON Responses replies from compatible providers. Keep this at the shared provider transport boundary so generation and scoring use the same SDK-compatible shape. Preserve existing annotations, output text, reasoning, tool calls, usage, request IDs, and HTTP status; leave malformed explicit values for SDK validation. Do not buffer or rewrite SSE, Chat Completions, official OpenAI replies, or HTTP errors. Keep custom-provider redirect restrictions and abort signals intact, and remove stale encoding and length headers when rewriting a decoded body. Cover the real SDK/Mastra path with deterministic responses containing reasoning followed by a message with omitted annotations.

Configure server-owned GenUI providers through `GENUI_MODEL_CONFIG_JSON` as an object keyed by public model name. Give every value its own upstream `model`, credentials, base URL, and optional API style, reasoning effort, positive-integer `maxOutputTokens` capability ceiling, and default marker. Outside Bench, a complete request-scoped `model`, `apiKey`, and `baseURL` may run without server model configuration; ignore partial custom-provider overrides as one unit at both request normalization and provider creation so a client endpoint or API style can never inherit a server-owned credential. Bench must not accept request-scoped provider connections. Each Bench group may independently select only a public model name returned by the server; drop unconfigured group model names rather than treating them as upstream model IDs. Never mix individual connection fields from different entries. Accept a request-scoped custom base URL only when it exactly matches an official OpenAI-compatible HTTPS endpoint in `ALLOWED_CUSTOM_PROVIDER_BASE_URLS`, allowing normalization of a trailing slash only; reject alternate origins, ports, paths, credentials, queries, and fragments, and disable redirect following for request-scoped provider fetches. Add endpoints only with official documentation and allow-list regression tests. Treat server-owned model configuration as trusted so operators can intentionally configure private, HTTP, or deployment-specific endpoints. Keep public responses, including `GET /models` and health endpoints, limited to public model names, configured prices, and readiness metadata; never expose server-owned upstream model ids, credentials, base URLs, API styles, or token ceilings. Redact both server-owned configuration and the current request's custom API key, including encoded and escaped variants, from upstream error names and messages before using the same sanitized payload for logs or client responses; never store request keys in global redaction state. Resolve an ordinary client model selection through its configured name before creating the provider. Require authentication on public deployments.

GenUI Server must never read or request `UI_JUDGE_SERVER_URL`. The Playground stores this address locally, checks `/health`, requests screenshots directly, and uploads BMP bytes to GenUI for model scoring. Judge-enabled Bench requests require `playground.browserScreenshots: true`; do not accept or retain a screenshot service address in job configuration. Issue bounded, cancellable screenshot tasks through SSE `screenshot-requested` events containing only a capture ID. Serve each pending task's protocol path and sanitized capture fields through `GET /a2ui/bench/jobs/:jobId/screenshots/:captureId`; accept bounded `image/bmp` uploads or JSON capture errors at the same path. Preserve the artifact text outside diagnostic/event redaction. Validate BMP before PNG conversion and score with the existing Bench group model. Never send provider credentials or model settings to the screenshot service. Keep screenshot bundle URLs server-owned and preserve capture safety checks, cancellation, scoring, and report limits.

Generate image assets through the optional shared Mastra `generate_image` capability for all five generation agents. Keep `enableImageGeneration` independent of `enableWebSearch`, default it to enabled, and omit the tool when explicitly disabled or when Ark configuration is missing or invalid. Include the image-generation setting in provider-agent cache keys and explicitly disable it in every Bench path. Missing image configuration must not fail overall health; expose only `imageGenerationReady`. Compose both capabilities in `agent/common/agent-capabilities.ts` and suggest generation in search guidance only when its tool is registered. OpenUI, Lynx XML, HTML, and MCP Apps await the tool before emitting complete protocol output; A2UI retains its suspension and continuation behavior. Prefix every image-generation environment variable with `IMG_GEN_`: require `IMG_GEN_ARK_API_KEY`, `IMG_GEN_ARK_IMAGE_MODEL`, and `IMG_GEN_ARK_IMAGE_BASE_URL` without silent defaults, and use `IMG_GEN_ARK_IMAGE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` for the optional timeout. Keep those values server-only and expose only image-generation readiness through health responses. The tool should accept an image prompt, start one non-streaming URL request to Volcengine Ark, honor upstream abort signals and a bounded timeout, and return only the generated URL plus non-sensitive metadata. Only A2UI suspends while that request runs and receives the result when its service resumes the same run. The tool must never construct A2UI messages. Before suspension, the A2UI agent must emit a complete independently renderable A2UI array containing the theme/body and a stable-id `Loading` placeholder. After the image result resumes it, the agent—not the tool or route—must emit the smallest `updateComponents` / `updateDataModel` patch for the existing surface and reuse the placeholder id. Keep the SSE response open across this continuation and send `done` only after the resumed patch is validated. Give each HTTP request one Mastra RequestContext-backed image-generation scope, reuse it across the initial generation, every resumed segment, and every validation repair, reserve calls synchronously before I/O, and enforce a small total call budget. Track URLs returned in that scope and allow only those or sources explicitly provided by the user/host to pass final validation or stream to the renderer; do not trust HTTPS shape alone. Do not restore Pexels search, Picsum placeholders, or another silent fallback; if image generation fails, resume the agent with that failure so it can replace or remove the pending image presentation using other catalog components.

Treat Mastra's result-level `suspendPayload` as a tool-call event envelope. Unwrap its nested tool payload before validating application fields such as `jobId`, and preserve the envelope's `toolCallId` when calling `resumeStream` or `resumeGenerate` so concurrent suspended tools resume the matching call. Mastra `Agent.stream()` is asynchronous; await it before storing its result inside another object, and make test doubles return a Promise so missing awaits cannot be hidden. Continuation tests must reproduce this envelope instead of putting the custom tool payload directly on the result.

Register every suspend-capable A2UI agent with the process-wide Mastra runtime so the initial run can persist its workflow snapshot before `resumeStream` or `resumeGenerate` looks it up. The current `InMemoryStore` intentionally supports only continuations that stay in one live server process; do not claim that in-flight image generation survives a restart or moves between replicas. A persistent workflow store alone is not enough for that deployment model because pending image jobs are also process-local. Keep at least one continuation regression test on the real Mastra Agent and storage path instead of mocking the resume method.

When combining the text from a suspended streaming run, treat the text consumed from each phase's `textStream` as authoritative. A real Mastra resumed result may expose the pre-suspension output again through `result.text` while its `textStream` contains the new continuation patch; use `result.text` only when that phase emitted no streamed text, and cover this behavior in service tests.

Integrate the subscription-compatible Doubao Search Custom API as optional server-side Mastra `web_search` and `image_search` tools, enabled only by `SEARCH_INFINITY_API_KEY`; use `SEARCH_INFINITY_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` for their bounded timeout and never accept search credentials or endpoints from clients. Keep search types, request parameters, and result sizes server-owned. Normalize `WebResults` to bounded text summaries and source metadata, preferring each result's `Summary`, with `Snippet` and bounded `Content` only as fallbacks. Normalize `ImageResults` to HTTP(S) image URLs plus bounded source and quality metadata, and instruct the agent to prefer `image_search` before `generate_image` unless the user explicitly requests original generated artwork. Redact upstream response bodies from failures. Store the shared search call budget, returned document URLs, and returned image URLs in the same per-request RequestContext used by image generation so the limit spans both tools, initial generation, and repairs. Allow `openUrl` only for URLs supplied in user-role messages or returned as source pages by the current search scope. Allow renderer image sources only when supplied by the user or host, returned by the current `image_search` scope, or returned by `generate_image`; withhold untrusted sources during streaming and reject them during final validation. Explicitly disable both search tools and image generation for every Bench path to preserve deterministic scoring.

Compose `web_search` and `image_search` through the protocol-neutral `agent/common/search-capability.ts` for all five generation agents (A2UI, OpenUI, Lynx XML, HTML, and MCP Apps). Keep `enableWebSearch` in shared chat options and include its effective value in provider-agent cache keys. Keep the search tool descriptions independent of A2UI component fields and only suggest `generate_image` when that tool is actually registered. Give each request its own tool RequestContext and image-generation budget; reuse the same capability context across A2UI continuations and repairs. Search calls must finish before final protocol output, remain internal to the server, and never become OpenUI Query/Mutation calls or MCP Apps routing targets. Permit returned image URLs in HTML and Lynx XML prompting without permitting arbitrary scripted network requests or external scripts. Preserve A2UI source validation and keep UI Judge scoring agents tool-free. Test real Mastra multi-step search execution with deterministic model and fetch mocks, including cache reuse, disabled-search cache separation, and streaming delivery.

Build A2UI source provenance policies through the shared `createA2UISourcePolicy` collector and inject a purpose-specific normalizer. Keep image-source and `openUrl` wrappers responsible for their different accepted source schemes instead of duplicating recursive extraction or weakening `openUrl` to accept image-only, file, or relative sources.

Publish A2UI and OpenUI preview payloads and protocol-aware shared conversations to Volcengine TOS with the native server-side SDK. Require `TOS_ACCESS_KEY`, `TOS_SECRET_KEY`, `TOS_BUCKET`, and `TOS_REGION`; do not silently fall back to a bucket or region. Keep keys in the canonical `<method>/<type>/<uuid>/<file>` layout: allow only `a2ui`, `openui`, `mcp-apps`, `lynx-xml`, or `html` as the method and only `preview` or `conversation` as the type. Store A2UI preview messages and action mocks under `a2ui/preview`, OpenUI source under `openui/preview`, and shared conversations under their validated protocol's `conversation` path. Keep TOS AK/SK or temporary STS credentials on the server, grant that identity only `tos:PutObject` for the configured method prefixes, and do not set a public object ACL during upload. The bucket policy owns public reads; return an unsigned public bucket URL to preview clients.

For plain-text protocol streams such as OpenUI, Lynx XML, and HTML, keep shared body validation, provider selection, logging, cancellation propagation, SSE framing, and finalization in `app/common/text-stream-route.ts`. Protocol routes should provide only their scope, path, service, and optional final-text normalization. Log and preserve final usage and finish-reason metadata before whole-document validation so invalid output remains diagnosable; when `finishReason` is `length`, identify the exhausted model output budget in the error instead of reporting only the downstream envelope failure. Whole-document routes must normalize away model prose or Markdown fences and reject an incomplete document envelope before emitting `done`. HTML output must be a self-contained document that is safe to place in the Playground's sandboxed `srcDoc`; keep browser execution on the client rather than adding a server-side HTML runtime.

When finalizing a Mastra result, prefer its aggregate `totalUsage` and fall back to the final step's `usage`, then include the selected usage in the SSE `done` frame. Preserve that usage and finish reason through `GenerationPostprocessError` when deterministic assembly fails, including SSE errors and Bench repair attempts. Keep model output available for repair without counting local compilation as a model step.

Expose playground payload uploads through `PUT /a2ui/payload` and `PUT /openui/payload`, returning the uploaded public URL in the response. Keep storage-provider endpoints and credentials out of playground code. Preserve POST support while older clients may still use it.

Use `app/common/sse.ts` for standard SSE frames and response headers. Pass event IDs or additional headers through its options instead of cloning the SSE framing and header literals in individual functions.

Build `genui-server` as an executable ESM Hono server through `rslib.config.ts`. Each protocol `route.ts` default-exports a Hono sub-application, `src/app.ts` composes the route tree and common HTTP fallbacks, and `src/index.ts` starts `@hono/node-server` and owns graceful process shutdown. Do not export endpoint request functions or add a custom router or Node/FaaS transport adapter. Keep business handlers based on standard Web `Request` and `Response` internally.

Keep Rslib's ESM `__dirname` shim enabled while bundling runtime dependencies with `autoExternal: false`. The Volcengine TOS SDK transitively loads `tos-crc64-js`, whose CommonJS initialization reads `__dirname`; leaving that identifier unshimmed makes the executable ESM bundle fail during startup.

For package-local development under pnpm 12.3.4, run the `dev:build` and `dev:server` regex selector without `--parallel`. The plain regex selector starts both scripts concurrently; adding `--parallel` enters workspace execution and runs this package's matched scripts sequentially, so the persistent build watcher prevents the server script from starting. Verify the listening log as well as successful compilation when diagnosing development startup. `start` only runs the existing `dist/index.js` and does not rebuild or watch source files.

Read the server port from `LYNX_USE_PORT`, defaulting to `3000`; do not use `PORT` as a compatibility fallback.

Read the bind address from `LYNX_USE_HOST`, defaulting to the IPv6 unspecified address `::` so Node accepts both IPv6 and IPv4 connections through its dual-stack listener; do not use `HOST` as a compatibility fallback. Format IPv6 addresses with brackets when logging HTTP URLs.

Derive CORS preflight and 405 `Allow` behavior from the composed Hono application's route table after mounting sub-applications. Do not maintain a second hand-written route and method inventory.

Every SSE route that starts model generation must propagate both `Request.signal` aborts and response-stream cancellation to the upstream model call. Guard enqueues and stream closure against reader cancellation, remove abort listeners during cleanup, and cover the disconnect path with a test.

Bound graceful process shutdown so long-lived SSE connections cannot block it indefinitely. Track and destroy remaining connections after the grace period in a way that works for both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2; do not rely only on HTTP/1-specific server methods.

Target the repository-supported Node.js 22 and 24 release lines. Let `@hono/node-server` own HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 request adaptation, including HTTP/2 pseudo-header filtering; do not recreate that transport code locally. Use explicit `.js` specifiers for relative ESM imports and re-exports so TypeScript resolves the source modules while the emitted JavaScript remains valid native Node ESM.

Keep per-invocation model usage and tool diagnostics in `service/common/agent-step-logger.ts` and reuse it across generation agents and UI Judge. Route events through the request's performance callback when available, otherwise use server logs; never retain counters on cached agents. Log numeric usage, tool statuses, and character counts without raw prompts, reasoning, tool arguments/results, or provider request bodies. Read tool failures from step content as well as `toolResults`; Mastra can omit failed calls from `toolResults`. Preserve sanitized error messages and call IDs, and test real failure/retry delivery. Keep absent usage unknown and distinguish callback-step sums from SDK aggregate usage during continuations. Include sanitized result-level failure diagnostics in agent.model.completed: error name/message, HTTP status, upstream request ID, response content type and character count, and a bounded cause chain. Distinguish SDK JSON parsing failures from response-schema validation failures without logging the response value; JSON parse messages and nested SyntaxError messages may quote body text. Never include request/response bodies or unrelated headers, and verify these diagnostics through real SDK failures with deterministic HTTP mocks.

Use the shared logger's onError callback to emit agent.model.error for direct SDK exceptions, which can bypass onFinish entirely. Keep result-level failure details in agent.model.completed when that callback runs. Do not infer zero model usage from a response that failed SDK parsing.

Read Mastra's result error after awaiting completion. Failed model results must
raise a shared upstream-generation error before protocol validation or fragment
compilation, preserving available usage and finish reason. Text SSE errors expose
the sanitized message, HTTP status, and `upstreamRequestId` separately from the
local request ID; never forward provider request/response bodies or all headers.
If the provider supplies no reason, report an upstream failure rather than a
missing artifact. Keep Bench usage for failed model attempts.

When diagnosing streamed generation failures, distinguish the local SSE HTTP
status from upstream model success. Aggregate usage and duplicate client error
entries do not establish the number of upstream calls; use
`agent.model.step.completed` and `agent.model.error` to identify the failing
step. Reasoning-only output has no artifact prefix to continue. Do not reinterpret
an upstream error as token truncation solely because its reported output usage
equals the token budget. Ordinary artifact recovery requires `length`; the
separate reasoning-only restart above preserves an original upstream error and
requires all of its additional evidence checks.

Expose optional per-model `input_price`, `cached_price`, and `output_price` from `GENUI_MODEL_CONFIG_JSON` through `GET /models`, defaulting each omitted price to zero and validating finite non-negative numbers. Prices are per million tokens in the deployment's common currency. Keep money calculation on the client. Preserve raw generation `usage` and expose normalized `tokenUsage` with input, cached, and output counts across every generation response; unreported dimensions are null, not zero. Cached input is included in total input, and reasoning is included in output, so subtract cache hits before applying the ordinary input rate. Sum independent validation-repair attempts, including the initial streamed attempt, without double-counting SDK aggregate usage across suspended/resumed phases. Never drop known usage merely because validation failed.
