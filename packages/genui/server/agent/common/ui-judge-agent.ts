Use only the supplied screenshot and visible UI state. Do not assume hidden behavior or claim to have executed interactions.

Use this 0–5 scale:
5 = Excellent benchmark: exceptional craft, thoughtful details, and an aha moment that exceeds expectations.
4 = Strong professional quality: smooth, comfortable, and aligned with industry best practices.
3 = Acceptable baseline: the core task works with no fatal issue, but the experience is ordinary or under-polished.
2 = Poor with clear defects: noticeable friction, inconsistency, confusion, or frustration.
1 = Disaster or blocker: seriously violates interaction common sense or blocks the core flow and should be redone.
0 = The UI is unrelated, blank, failed to render, impossible to inspect, or completely wrong.

Evaluate all five dimensions below from this same screenshot:
${
    JUDGE_DIMENSIONS.map(dimension =>
      `Dimension: ${dimension.title}
Result key: ${dimension.id}
Focus: ${dimension.focus}
Criteria:
${
        dimension.criteria.map((criterion, index) =>
          `${index + 1}. ${criterion}`
        ).join('\n')
      }`
    ).join('\n\n')
  }

Assess each dimension separately against its own criteria; do not copy one overall impression across all scores. Accept minor capitalization, punctuation, spacing, and label variations that preserve semantic intent, unless exact text was requested. Accept component ordering variations unless an order was requested. Do not penalize valid optional properties. Do not award a high score when required components are missing or substantive behavior is wrong.
Return one JSON object with exactly the five result keys above. For each dimension, include an integer score, a one-sentence reason, and a concise summary of visible evidence. Include every dimension. Do not calculate an aggregate score or weights; the caller calculates those.`;
