# @lynx-js/web-style-transformer

## 0.15.5

## 0.15.4

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix `index_bg.wasm` not found when publishing. ([#1277](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/1277))

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- refactor: improve `linear-weight-sum` performance ([#1216](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/1216))

- perf: use rust implemented style transformer ([#1094](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/1094))

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- fix: --lynx-color will be removed, and if color contains `gradient` it will be processed as transparent. ([#1069](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/1069))

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: improve compatibility for chrome 108 & support linear-gradient for nested x-text ([#590](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/590))

  **This is a breaking change**

  - Please upgrade your `@lynx-js/web-elements` to >=0.6.0
  - Please upgrade your `@lynx-js/web-core` to >=0.12.0
  - The compiled lynx template json won't be impacted.

  On chrome 108, the `-webkit-background-clip:text` cannot be computed by a `var(--css-var-value-text)`

  Therefore we move the logic into style transformation logic.

  Now the following status is supported

  ```
  <text style="color:linear-gradient()">
    <text>
    <text>
  </text>
  ```

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- feat: 1. list adds support for the `sticky` attribute. Now sticky-offset, sticky-top, and sticky-bottom will only take effect when `sticky` is `true`. ([#257](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/257))

  2. Added support for `list-main-axis-gap`, `list-cross-axis-gap`.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Support NPM provenance. ([#30](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/30))

- feat: support `justify-content`, `align-self` in linear container ([#37](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/37))

  Now these two properties could work in a linear container.

  We don't transforms the `justify-content` and `align-self` to css vars any more.

  The previous version of `@lynx-js/web-core` won't work with current `@lynx-js/web-core` after this change.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 2738fdc: feat: support linear-direction

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e406d69: refractor: update output json format

  **This is a breaking change**

  Before this change the style info is dump in Javascript code.

  After this change the style info will be pure JSON data.

  Now we're using the css-serializer tool's output only. If you're using plugins for it, now they're enabled.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 39cf3ae: feat: improve performance for supporting linear layout

  Before this commit, we'll use `getComputedStyle()` to find out if a dom is a linear container.

  After this commit, we'll use the css variable cyclic toggle pattern and `@container style()`

  This feature requires **Chrome 111, Safari 18**.

  We'll provide a fallback implementation for firefox and legacy browsers.

  After this commit, your `flex-direction`, `flex-shrink`, `flex`, `flex-grow`, `flex-basis` will be transformed to a css variable expression.
